Aerial photo collection followed protocals from Finkbeiner et al. (2001). Based on these guidelines, photos were taken at a low sun angle, two hours withing low tide, when wind and atmospheric haze were minimal, and when water clarity was high. Altitude of the aircraft during photo aquisition was about 16,000ft (Quantum Spatial, 2016). Water clarity was measured by volunteers using secchi disks as target dates for acquisition of aerial photography approached. Aerial imagery was turned into an orthophotographic basemap by the photogrammetric vendor (Quantum Spatial). Photo signatures of SAV were delineated on the orthophotography and taken into the field for verification. Field verification was done using GPS and underwater video. Final delineations of SAV polygons included field verification of the deep water edge and other GPS points collected on the water.</abstract><purpose>Submerged aquatic vegetation beds (SAV) are a critical estuarine habitat.  In Rhode Island, the main species of SAV is eelgrass (Zostera marina).  Mapping the extent and quantifying the acreage of eelgrass is a critical first step toward understanding, managing, and protecting these vital habitats.  SAV has been identified as a critical marine resource and is currently protected by both Federal and state legislation. As such the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has a stated policy on the assessment, protection, and study of SAV as a recommendation for all member states.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20160615</caldate></sngdate><sngdate><caldate>20160626</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>ground condition</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-71.896844</westbc><eastbc>-71.179956</eastbc><northbc>41.700261</northbc><southbc>41.162938</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>SAV</themekey><themekey>eelgrass</themekey><themekey>2016</themekey><themekey>widgeon grass</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt><themekey>biota</themekey><themekey>environment</themekey></theme><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>Rhode Island</placekey><placekey>coastal</placekey><placekey>coastal ponds</placekey><placekey>Narragansett Bay</placekey><placekey>Block Island</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>These data are presented as is and it is up to the user of these data to understand the accuracy and associated error included herein.

Historical datasets from 2012 and 2006 were also used to zero-in on potential areas of SAV.   Polygons were loaded onto a GPS enabled tablet with ArcPad and taken out on a boat for field investigations.  We used an underwater video camera to verify presence of eelgrass.  We collected GPS points in the field and coded them as having eelgrass or not.  We focused on the center of the polygon and the deepwater edge of the eelgrass beds.  Final delineations of eelgrass were adjusted to include the GPS field data.  Not all polygons were field visited.  As such we included a field (ground-truth year) in the attribute table.</procdesc><procdate>20160915</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>University of Rhode Island - Environmental Data Center</cntorg><cntper>Michael Bradley</cntper></cntorgp><cntpos>Research Associate</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype><address>103 Coastal Institute Kingston</address><city>Kingston</city><state>RI</state><postal>02881</postal><country>US</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>401-874-5054</cntvoice><cntemail>mike@edc.uri.edu</cntemail></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Data contributed to RIGIS by the University of Rhode Island Environmental Data Center.
