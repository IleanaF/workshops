## 2018 USEPA R User Group Workshop Agenda

#### On-line participation details:

There will be a remote participation option for the presentations and workshops.  Details will be posted here closer to workshop date.

#### On-site details:

The workshop is being held at the [US EPA campus in Research Triangle Park, NC] (https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-epas-campus-research-triangle-park-rtp-north-carolina).  Details and directions for those visiting will be posted at a later date.

#### Workshop summaries:

- **Introduction to R (Full Day):** Participants in this workshop will be introduced to R through the lense of the "Tidyverse" as well as learn basics of the R Language for statistical computing.  In particular we will: 1) learn the fundamentals of R including syntax, functions, and packages; 2) spend quality time with the core R data structure, the data frame; 3) learn how to manipulate our data with the `dplyr` and `tidyr` packages; and 4) gain expereince creating data visualizations with `ggplot2`.  Our goal is to set learners up with a foundation for future exploration of R.
- **Working with Spatial Data in R (Half Day):** This workshop will focus on the fundamentals of working with spatial data in R – reading and writing spatial data, dealing with map projections, packages for handling both vector and raster data, and visualizing and mapping spatial data in R.  After covering fundamentals, we’ll move through example exercise demonstrating spatial operations such as spatial joins, spatial subsetting, spatial aggregatuibm cropping raster data, and extracting raster data for points and we’ll make use of packages such as sf, sp, raster, rgdal, maptools, and several others.  A basic working knowledge of R will be assumed.
- **Using LaTeX and Markdown for Reproducible Research (Half Day):** Taking a modular approach and a stepwise fashion, participants will be introduced to the basics of LaTeX, Markdown, and the R package knitr. Participants will then get to use these modules synchronously to facilitate reproducible reports and research with R.
- **Network Analysis/Graph Analysis techniques (Half Day):** Networks and graphs are a flexible framework for organizing complex interactions between large number of entities.  In this workshop, using the igraph package in R, we will start from scratch by building a small network.  We will then import a larger more complicated network and go through the process of encoding node and edge attributes.  We will discuss graph layout options and complete some standard analyses.  In the end, participants will gain a familiarity with the how to build, import, visualize and analyze networks in R.
- **Shiny (Half Day):**
