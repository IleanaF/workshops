# US EPA Region 7/Atlantic Ecology Division R-a-palooza

This repository contains materials for a series of short workshops and presentations on the use of the R Language for statistical computing.  Jeff Hollister from the Office of Research and Developments Atlantic Ecolgy Division will be running the workshops and presentation for Region 7 Staff.  Over the course of three days we will cover the folling topics:

- Introduction to R 
- Spatial Data Analysis with R
- Reproducible Research
- Open science approach for understanding cyanobacteria blooms

The goal of these workshops and presentatins is to provide a solid basis for futher learning in R, introduce more advanced topics, and given an overview of how the Atlantic Ecology Division is utilizing open science and the R Language in its cyanobacteria research efforts.
