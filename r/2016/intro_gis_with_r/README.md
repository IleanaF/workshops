#Introduction to GIS with R

This 1/2 day workshop will provide attendees with an introduction to doing basic GIS analyses using the R Language for Statistical Computing.  After attending this workshop, you will be able to:

- get all appropriate software and packages installed and running
- know how read in a variety of vector and raster spatial data formats
- know how to conduct some basic spatial analyses
- use a variety of approaches for visualizing spatial data with R
- know how and where to get help

##Pre-requisites
It is expected that you have some familiarity with R and RStudio, can install packages from CRAN, and understand basic R syntax.

##Software
We will be using R and RStudio for this workshop.  This must be installed prior to March 2.  Simply email EZTech and request that R and RStudio be installed on your machine.  They will push that out usually in a day or so.

##Agenda
The draft agenda is below:

## Learn more!
As these materials are filtered through my experience, I like to also link to other materials presenting the same ideas.  A couple of really great examples are linked below.

- [NEON Data Skills Tutorials](http://neondataskills.org/tutorial-series/)
- [Jamie Afflerbach's Workshop for UCSB](https://github.com/jafflerbach/spatial-analysis-R)

## Webinar
While this workshop will be run with local attendees in mind, it will be broadcast and recorded for future playback.

In addition, the materials in this GitHub repository will be left open to the public and should provide enough details to get set-up and started with using GIS in R.
