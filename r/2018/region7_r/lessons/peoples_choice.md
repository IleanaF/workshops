# People's Choice
The last lesson is planned to be unplanned...  We can focus the last hour or so on topics that are of interest to the group.  I have provided links below to materials I have used in the past.  We can work through some of those or we can go off in a different direction and choose something not on the list.  

## Possible Lessons:

- [GIS with R](#gis-with-r)
- [GitHub and Version Control](#github-and-version-control)
- [Iteration and Automating Taks](#iteration-and-automating-tasks)
- [Functions and Control Structures](#functions-and-control-structures)
- [Markdown and Reproducible Research](#markdown-and-reproducible-research)
- [Stump the Chump](#stump-the-chump)

## GIS with R

This is near and dear to my heart as this is what I spend most of my research efforts on, spatial data analysis in R.  We can go over the basics using the materials from a [1/2 day workshop on GIS with R](https://github.com/usepa/intro_gis_with_r) 

## Github and Version Control 

While not R, using GitHub and Git for version control is a topic that is relevant to development in R and also very useful for tracking changes to scientific products.  We can dig into the [Git and GitHub 101 repository](https://github.com/usepa/github_101)

## Iteration and Automating Tasks

I don't have materials yet for this one, but we can wing it.  We'll discuss `for` and `while` loops.  We can also look at the `purrr` package which provides tidy methods for iteration.  I have only played with this a bit recently so we will be learning together.

## Functions and Control Structures

As we now know, functions are at the heart of R.  We can spend some time on how to develop your own functions and talk about some of the R programming control structures (loops, if-else, etc.).  We'll look at the [USGS introductory R materials](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/intro-curriculum/Reproduce/#using-conditional-if-else-statements).

## Markdown and Reproducible Research

Again, this isn't R, per se, but many R packages and especially work by the RStudio team has moved the ability to create reproducible documents, interwined with R code, forward.  We will look at the [USGS materials](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/intro-curriculum/Reproduce/#markdown)

## Stump the Chump

None of the other options of interest?  Let's work on something together.  I might have some experience with other topics and if not, we can try to figure things out together!
