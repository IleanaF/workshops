### Introduction to R for Analysis of Coastal and Estuarine Data

*Conveners: Jeffrey W. Hollister (hollister.jeff@epa.gov), Marcus W. Beck (beck.marcus@epa.gov)*

*Sunday, Nov. 5, 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM*

### Short description (100 words)

The [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language for statistical computing is a powerful tool with many data science and analysis applications.  Challenges to using R are a steep learning curve and a staggering amount of contributed packages. This series of workshops will provide the foundations for continued learning of R in the context of coastal and estuarine data. A morning session will introduce the R language and two afternoon sessions will cover basic spatial analysis and evaluation of time series data. Attendees will have an understanding of how R can facilitate effective analyses and will leave with the necessary resources for continued learning.

### Long description (500 words)
 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language.  Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences.  The popularity of R has in part been facilitated by its strong user base, which has contributed over 10000 supporting packages.  In addition to a steep learning curve, a primary challenge in effective use of this software is knowing which packages are most relevant for estuarine and coastal research.  This series of workshops will address these issues by providing attendees with the foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis of coastal and estuarine data.  The three topic areas will be: Introduction to R the language, spatial analysis of estuarine data in R, and time series analysis of estuarine data in R.

In the morning session, attendees will learn the basics of the R language to overcome initial challenges of using a command-line interface.  The topics will include basics of R syntax, data structures, reading and writing data, data manipulation, and basic data visualization tools. The afternoon sessions will focus on specific topics in the context of coastal and estuarine data. The first afternoon session will introduce attendees to basic spatial analysis. The lessons and guided examples will demonstrate use of R to replace and augment common spatial analyses that are typically performed in proprietary software.  The second afternoon session will cover basic analyses for time series data, with a specific focus on data from continuous water quality monitors or discrete sampling events over multiple years.  Topics to be covered will include statistical properties of time series, QAQC screening, exploratory analysis, and formal trend analysis methods (e.g., Seasonal Kendall tests). Popular R packages will be introduced for each of the topics.

No prior experience is required for the Introduction to the R language session.  For the spatial and time series analysis workshops, attendees are expected to know the basics of R that will be covered in the introduction, in addition to basic principles for the special topics (e.g., geoprocessing, properties of time series, etc.).  Attendees must bring their own laptops with the most recent versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/) installed. Attendees will leave the workshop with an understanding of how R can facilitate effective analyses and will have the necessary resources for continued learning. All lessons will be presented with a focus on the concepts of [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) and [reproducibility](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/), both of which are fundamental principles that will lead to improved data analysis.
