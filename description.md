# Introduction to R for Analysis of Coastal and Estuarine Data

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language.  Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences.  This series of workshops will provide attendees with the foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis coastal and estuarine data.  The three topic areas will be: Introduction to R the language, spatial analysis of estuarine data in R, and time series analysis of estuarine data in R.  

## Intro R

In this first workshop, attendees will learn the basics of the R language, including: syntax, data structures, reading and writing data, data manipulation, and basic data visualization tools.  All lessons will be presented with a focus on the concepts of [tidy data]() and [reproducibility](), which will provide attendees with a solid basis for continued learning.

## Special Topics in R: Spatial


## Special Topics in R: Time Series


## Pre-requisites

No prior experience is required for the Introduction to the R language session.  For the spatial and time series analysis workshops you are expected to know the basics of R that will be covered in the introduction
