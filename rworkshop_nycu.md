--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Atlantic Ecology Division Research Ecologist, Dr. Jeffrey Hollister, with the help of Gulf Ecology Division Branch Chief Dr. Jim Hagy, and ORISE Postdoc Dr. Marcus Beck, developed and delivered Introdcutory R Workshops**
- Three separate 2 day introductory R workshops were presented by Dr. Hollister in January and February of 2015.
- Discussions between Drs. Hagy, Beck, and Hollister resulted in the development of Introductory R materials that were presented to ~20 GED staff on January 14-15, and ~20 AED staff on January 7-8 and February 24-25.  Participants worked through lessons on using R within a typical data analysis workflow and learned how to read, manipulate, and clean data with R as well as conduct some basics analyses.  Participants also developed visualizations with the popular R pacakge, `ggplot2` and received a brief introduction to programming with R and using R for reproducible research.
