# Introduction to R for Analysis of Coastal and Estuarine Data

Instructors: *Dr. Jeffrey Hollister, hollister.jeff@epa.gov, Dr. Marcus W. Beck, beck.marcus@epa.gov*

*Sunday Nov. 5, 2017, 8:30am - 4:30pm* 

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language.  Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences.  This series of workshops will provide attendees with the foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis of coastal and estuarine data.  The three topic areas will be: Introduction to R the language, spatial analysis of estuarine data in R, and time series analysis of estuarine data in R.

## Intro R 

*3 hrs, 8:30am - 11:30am*

In the morning session, attendees will learn the basics of the R language, including: syntax, data structures, reading and writing data, data manipulation, and basic data visualization tools.  All lessons will be presented with a focus on the concepts of [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) and [reproducibility](http://kbroman.org/steps2rr/), which will provide attendees with a solid basis for continued learning.

## Special Topics in R: Spatial

*2 hrs, 12:30pm - 2:30pm*

The first afternoon session will introduce attendees to basic spatial analysis of coastal and estuarine data in R. Popular R packages for spatial analysis will be introduced, including: [maptools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/index.html), [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html), [rgeos](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgeos/index.html), and [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html). The lessons and guided examples will demonstrate use of R to replace and augment common spatial analyses that are typically performed in proprietary software.

## Special Topics in R: Time Series

*1.5 hrs, 3:00pm - 4:30pm*

The second afternoon session will cover basic analyses for time series data, with a specific focus on data from continuous water quality monitors or discrete sampling events over multiple years.  Topics to be covered will include statistical properties of time series data, QAQC screening, exploratory analysis, and formal trend analysis methods (e.g., Seasonal Kendall tests). R packages to be used will include [EnvStats](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EnvStats/index.html), [lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html), [SWMPr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SWMPr/index.html), and [zoo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html). 

## Pre-requisites

No prior experience is required for the Introduction to the R language session.  For the spatial and time series analysis workshops you are expected to know the basics of R that will be covered in the introduction, in addition to basic principles for the special topics (e.g., geoprocessing, properties of time series, etc.). Attendees must bring a laptop with the most recent versions of R and RStudio.
