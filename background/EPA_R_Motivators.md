# Motivations for learning and using R at EPA #
R has many uses at EPA, including Region One's Boston Office and Chelmsford Lab
## Powerful ##
* R can very easily handle datasets that would be unwieldly to handle in a spreadsheet.
## Free ##
* Free is good at an agency whose intramural budgets have declined dramatically over the past decade or two.
* Good statistical packages historically are expensive. R's "competitors" still are. However, R is very solid, powerful, and robust, and yet is free.

## Scripting Language ##
* Because R is a scripting program (really a functional statistical programming language) it is relatively easy to retrace steps to find and fix data handling or analysis problems.  This would be much harder to do in something interactive like a spreadsheet or a GUI-driven statistical package. 

## Examples ##
Some interesting, but far from exhaustive, ones below

### Water ###
* Mystic River data analysis and grade validation.
* USGS gage data
* NWIS water quality data
* Lake Champlain water quality dataset (Massive multi-site multi-parameter since 1990)

### Air ###
* National air monitoring analysis.

### Waste ###
* Sample result analysis, static or geospatial

### Enforcement ###
* Analysis of ICIS data, ECHO data, etc

### Chemistry ###
* Construction and analysis of big data sets
* Chemometrics (chemical fingerprinting)
