# Motivations for learning and using R at EPA #
R has many uses at EPA, including Region One's Boston Office and Chelmsford Lab
## Powerful ##

## Free ##
* Free is good at an agency whose intramural budgets have declined dramatically over the past decade or two.
* Good statistical packages historically are expensive. R's "competitors" still are. However, R is very solid, powerful, and robust, and yet is free.
## Scripting Language ##
* Because R is a scripting program (really a functional statistical programming language) it is relatively easy to retrace steps to find and fix data handling or analysis problems.  This would be much harder to do in something interactive like a spreadsheet or a GUI-driven statistical package.
